# welcome
## This is not an all-in-one guide, and is more of an extension on [Pirate Software's Guide](https://github.com/EchoTheDeveloper/adobe_alternatives/blob/main/README.md). This is all from my exerience and also extensive research.

# Who am I?
I am EchoTheDeveloper, I have been programming and developing games since 2019. As of writing this I have no published games but I am currently working on a Game Engine and the Goblin Mod Maker. I have spent hours making games for me and my friends to play on countless different engines and frameworks. In this guide I will try to be as unbiased as possible. However, just to clear the water, I will give my personal opinion on each framework/engine when I talk about it. This is for transparency and it will not influence what I have to say about it.

# Software
## Engines
### Unity
Unity is a great engine with a free tier! I personally use unity for my game prototypes and the Goblin Mod Maker is made to work with Unity games. Unity is great becaue of the amount of documentation and community there is! I personally use unity and its one of my favorite engines.

**2D&3D**

**Pros:**
- Has been around for a long time
- Large community
- Free to use if your game makes under 1 million dollars in a year!

**Cons:**
- Has had some [controversy](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/heres-why-so-many-video-game-developers-are-suddenly-abandoning-the-unity-engine/)
- Not 100% free
- Not open-source

###Â Godot
Godot is a great popular fully free and open source (FOSS) game engine! It, like unity, supports both 2D and 3D development. Over the past few years (with the release of Godot 4) it has vastly improved and become more popular with an ever growing community and an increasing amount on contributers!

**Pros:**
- Fully Free - No weird licences.
- Fully Open Source - Have a feature you need? Create an issue on it's github! Or even better, if you are good at programming, make a pull request!
- Growing community - If you have any issues with the engines there is a huge and growing community of godot developers out there who can help you with any issues that may arise.

**Cons:**
- Relatively new - The amount of documentation and size of the community may not be as large as one of an engine such as Unity.
- No Console support - Due to its open-source nature, if you want to port your game onto consoles or other devices, you will either have to do it yourself or hire a team to do it for you, both of which can be costly and timely.
